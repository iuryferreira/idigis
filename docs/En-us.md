### âœŒ Hello!

Idigis is a church management system written in C# with TDD, DDD and Clean Architecture practices. It delivers an API Rest, which is consumed by Blazor WebAssembly that can be used in the browser, as in the cell phone through PWA. 

This system should make it possible to manage the main activities carried out in a community, making life easier for administrators.

### ðŸ›£ Roadmap

this project is under development, so things will be increased here until version 1.0 arrives.
